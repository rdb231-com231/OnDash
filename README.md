# OnDash
### Dashing forward on coding.

***

OnDash, the package that includes some cool Array's (and maybe Object's) Methods to be use.
OnDash is an simple and Open Source library, created to be like an piece of [CenterPack](https://github.com/rdb231-com231/centerpack.git) (install [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/centerpack)).

OnDash was made to be an simple and fun package for no important use at all. Just some random array's method. 
```js
    arr.split()
```
is an array method!

Please enjoy!
